### Hi there 👋
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Daijishō](https://github.com/TapiocaFox/Daijishou).
- 🌏 I'm from Taiwan, Formosa.
- 🧐 I've meddled with `C`, `C++`, `JavaScript`, `React.js`, `Python`, `Kotlin`, `Machine Learning`, `Micro Service`, `Embbeded System (IoT)`.
- 🌱 I’m currently interested to learn `Rust`, `Quant Finance`. 
- 🌱 Also I was interested to build a [Service System](https://github.com/NoXerve/NoXerve). But got no time for that currently.
- ⚡ You can try the [Reversi](https://nooxy.org/noversi) powered by ML and service framework made by me. 😄 
- 😏 I use Arch Linux btw.
