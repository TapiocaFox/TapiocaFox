### Hi there 👋
- 🔭 I’m the creator of the `Retro Game Management Software` [Daijishō](https://github.com/TapiocaFox/Daijishou) (~1M Total Users).
- 💪 Currently focusing on `Computer Graphics` and `Virtual Reality`.
- 🧐 I've meddled with `C`, `C++`, `JavaScript`, `React.js`, `Python`, `Kotlin`, `Machine Learning`, `Microservice`, `Embbeded System (IoT)`, `Geometric Modeling`.
- 🌱 I’m currently interested to learn `Rust`, `Svelte`, `Procedural Generation` and `GLSL`.
- 😏 I use Arch Linux btw.

#### I've also built projects like:
- [NoXerve](https://github.com/NoXerve/NoXerve): A "Service System" similar to CMS and Microservice that supports remote function call, with database and connection types abstraction.
- [Noversi](https://github.com/TapiocaFox/Noversi): Reversi game powered by ML written [purely in NumPy](https://github.com/TapiocaFox/NodeNet) and the "Service System" [NoXerve](https://github.com/NoXerve/NoXerve) mentioned above.
- [Note-G](https://github.com/TapiocaFox/Note-G): A portable music game console made with Arduino UNO. You can edit your music sheet on web and upload it to Arduino through bluetooth. Format like Open Music XML is supported.
- [Talksy](https://github.com/NOOXY-research/Talksy): A full-stack chat application with channel and permission control on top of [NoXerve](https://github.com/NoXerve/NoXerve).
