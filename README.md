<!-- #### I've also built projects like:
- [NoXerve](https://github.com/NoXerve/NoXerve): A "Service System" similar to CMS and Microservice that supports remote function call, with database and connection-type abstraction. It provides "nodejs" and "python3" environment and eliminate service designer to care about low level part of your project. Such as authorization, user system, database, protocol and so on.
- [Noversi](https://github.com/TapiocaFox/Noversi): Reversi game powered by ML written [purely in NumPy](https://github.com/TapiocaFox/NodeNet) and the "Service System" [NoXerve](https://github.com/NoXerve/NoXerve) mentioned above.
- [Note-G](https://github.com/TapiocaFox/Note-G): An Arduino UNO rhythm game project. You can edit your music sheet on the web and upload it to Arduino through bluetooth. Format like Open Music XML is supported.
- [Talksy](https://github.com/NOOXY-research/Talksy): A full-stack chat application with channel and permission control on top of [NoXerve](https://github.com/NoXerve/NoXerve).
